		Arctic Monkeys are an English indie rock band. Formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield, the band currently consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, lead/rhythm guitar), Jamie Cook (rhythm/lead guitar), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former members include Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Glyn Jones (lead vocals, rhythm guitar).
		The band have released four studio albums: Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), Humbug (2009) and Suck It and See (2011), as well as one live album At the Apollo (2008). The band's debut album became the fastest-selling debut album in British music history, surpassing Oasis' Definitely Maybe and remains the fastest-selling debut album for a band in the UK.
		Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first group of acts to come to the public attention via the Internet (fan-based sites rather than from the band), with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band are also regarded as one of the most prominent bands to be part of the post-punk revival in the UK, after achieving commercial success and spawning two number one singles with their debut album.

		Bell X1 are an Irish rock band from Dublin and County Kildare in Republic of Ireland, known for their wide range of styles, powerful live performances, intelligent and witty lyrics and a dedication to touring. NPR says they deliver “a brilliant co-mingling of electronic music and anthemic pop rock”. The band is named after the Bell X-1, the first supersonic aircraft.
		The band released their debut album Neither Am I in 2000. A second and third studio album, Music in Mouth (2003) and Flock (2005) followed respectively before Tour De Flock, a live CD and DVD set recorded in the Point Theatre, was released in 2007.
		In recent years Bell X1 have gained success in the United States after the song "Eve, the Apple of My Eye", taken from the Music in Mouth album, featured during an infamous lesbian kiss scene on an episode of The O.C.. Shortly afterwards they began frequent tours of the United States, culminating in live performances on the Late Show with David Letterman (twice), The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Flock, previously released exclusively in Ireland and later in the United Kingdom, received a North American release in February 2008. Blue Lights on the Runway—the band's fourth studio album was released in Ireland on 20 February 2009 and in the United States on 3 March 2009. It gave the band their second Choice Music Prize nomination. A fifth album, Bloodless Coup, released in 2011, gave the band their third Choice Music Prize nomination.
		Bell X1 are festival and arena headliners in their native Ireland and play to ever growing numbers on their regular US and European tours. The band recently had two songs in the Top 20 Irish Songs of All Time poll conducted by Dublin's Phantom 105.2 FM. Aside from U2, they are the Irish band with the most airplay in their native country and, according to Billboard, also the second biggest live performers.

		Keane are an English alternative rock band from Battle, East Sussex, formed in 1997. The group currently comprises Tim Rice-Oxley (piano, synthesisers, backing vocals), Richard Hughes (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Jesse Quin (bass guitar, electric guitar, backing vocals) and Tom Chaplin (lead vocals, acoustic guitar). Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001.
		Keane achieved mainstream success with the release of their debut album, Hopes and Fears, in 2004. The album won multiple awards, including the Brit Award for Best British Album, and was the second best-selling British album of the year. Their second studio album, Under the Iron Sea, continued the band's success, topping the album charts in the UK and debuting at No.4 on the Billboard 200 chart. Their third album, Perfect Symmetry was released in October 2008. The launch featured a series of symmetry-based installations including a 10m long half image of a sleeping woman pasted over 100 cardboard boxes and reflected in 400 mirror tiles on the floor to reveal a full person.
		In May 2008, both Hopes and Fears (number 13) and Under the Iron Sea (number 8) were voted by readers of Q magazine as among the best British albums ever, with Keane, The Beatles, Oasis and Radiohead the only artists having two albums in the top 20. Their EP, Night Train, was released in May 2010. Their fourth studio album, Strangeland, was released in May 2012, and again peaked at No.1 on the UK Albums Chart.
		Keane are known for using a piano (or a synth) as the lead instrument instead of guitars, differentiating them from most other rock bands. The inclusion of a distorted piano effect in 2006 and various synthesisers were a common feature in their music that back then combined the piano rock sound used during their first album and the more electronic sound which developed on the second and third albums. Since the start of their career, the band have sold over 10 million albums worldwide.
