<p class="heading">Lady Gaga donates $1m to Red Cross for Sandy Relief<p/>
<IMG SRC="lg.jpg" TITLE="ladygaga" class="image"/>
<p class="paragraph">Lady Gaga is donating $1 million to the Red Cross to aid those affected by Superstorm Sandy.
The New York-born singer posted on her blog Wednesday that she is pledging the money on behalf of her parents and sister. She also said she "would not be the woman or artist that I am today" if it weren't for places like the Lower Eastside, Harlem, the Bronx and Brooklyn.
She writes: "Thank you for helping me build my spirit. I will now help you rebuild yours."
Superstorm Sandy made landfall more than a week ago, killing many of its more than 100 victims in New York City and New Jersey and leaving millions without power.
Lady Gaga added that New York is a place full of "relentless ambition."

<p class="heading">Jermaine Jacksun: Singer files for name change<p/>
<IMG SRC="jermaine.jpg" TITLE="jermaine" class="image"/>
<p class="paragraph">Jermaine Jackson wants to change his name to something a little brighter. He's asking a court to allow him to alter his famous surname and become Jermaine Jacksun.
The older brother of Michael Jackson filed a name change petition on Tuesday in Los Angeles, stating the switch was for "artistic reasons."
The filing doesn't elaborate, but Jackson's friend Steve Dennis, who was speaking on the singer's behalf, said it's not unheard of for artists to change their names. "Phonetically, it changes nothing," he said.
"It is something he has chosen to do, and it's fair to say that you cannot blame this one on the boogie, you've got to blame it on the sunshine," Dennis said, in a play on the Jackson 5 disco hit, "Blame it on the Boogie."
Jackson has been touring with his brothers in recent months and has been promoting his book about his superstar brother titled "You Are Not Alone."
A hearing on whether Jackson will become Jacksun is scheduled for Feb. 22 in Los Angeles

<IMG SRC="robbie.jpg" TITLE="robbie" class="image"/>
<p class="paragraph">Demand to see Robbie live overtakes ex-band mate Gary as single reaches No 1.
Gary Barlow may have been honoured by the Music Industry Trust last night but Robbie Williams is the real winner in the battle of the Take That-ers according to the latest data from here, the world's largest ticket marketplace.

The site has seen searches for tickets to Robbie's O2 Arena dates in November quadruple since his single Candy went to number 1 in the music charts on Sunday.
Fans are proving that it's all about the music as Barlow's starring role on TV's X Factor has not yet translated into ticket demand for his tour.

<P class="heading">MEL C: SPICE GIRLS COULD REUNITE AGAIN<p/>
<IMG SRC="melc.jpg" TITLE="melc" class="image"/>
<p class="paragraph">Mel C says the Spice Girls would "definitely" like to take to the stage again.  The British band comprises of Mel, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Mel B and Geri Halliwell. Although they went on hiatus in 2000 they have reunited for a tour since then and also performed at the London 2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony.
They are set to reunite to promote a musical based on their songs called Viva Forever! later this year and Mel has hinted that isn't the only thing in the pipeline.
"It seems like we've been seeing more of each other now than we ever have. I think we'd definitely like to perform again! Who knows?" she laughed to Heat magazine.
There has been speculation that Victoria was never too keen on teaming up with her bandmates again. She is now a successful fashion designer, which she wants to concentrate on. 
It was recently claimed she is keen to forge a stronger bond with the other women again though, which Mel appears to have confirmed.
"I'm meeting up with Victoria around 10 December for a catch-up," she said. "All five of us will be in the same room the next day for the Viva Forever! launch It's so exciting."
The theatre production is a fictional work told using the girl group's tracks. They have been very involved with its production and Mel admits it's sometimes got a bit emotional for them.
"[The songs] just roll with the characters and the stories and the situations - it's amazing," Mel said. "It's brought us closer than we've ever been, we talk all the time now! It's making us nostalgic - hearing our songs."
